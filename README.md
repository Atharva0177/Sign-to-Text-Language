# Sign-to-Text Language Converter

The **Sign-to-Text Language Converter** is a Python-based application designed to translate sign language gestures into text in real-time. Utilizing computer vision and machine learning techniques, this tool aims to bridge the communication gap between sign language users and those unfamiliar with it.

## Features

- **Real-Time Translation**: Captures hand gestures via webcam and translates them into corresponding text instantly.
- **High Accuracy**: Employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a comprehensive dataset to ensure precise gesture recognition.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides an intuitive GUI for seamless interaction.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Atharva0177/Sign-to-Text-Language.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd Sign-to-Text-Language
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *Note: Ensure you have Python 3.x and pip installed on your system.*

## Usage

1. **Prepare the Dataset**:

   - Collect images or videos of sign language gestures.
   - Organize the data into respective folders for each gesture.
   - Update the dataset path in the script accordingly.

2. **Train the Model**:

   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

   *This script will train the CNN model using your dataset.*

3. **Run the Application**:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   *The application will access your webcam to capture and translate sign language gestures in real-time.*

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Tkinter (for GUI)

*All required packages can be installed using the `requirements.txt` file.*
